ROScopter
=========

This repository contains the ROS packages associated with flying a multirotor on the [ROSflight](http://rosflight.org) autopilot stack. The `roscopter` ROS package contains a high-level multirotor autopilot while the `roscopter_sim` package is used for simulation. 

The `roscopter` autopilot has been built with reference to Dr. Randy Beard's [Quadrotor Dynamics and Control](http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2324&context=facpub) notes, so as to allow anyone to easily understand, modify and use the code. The framework developed in the aforementioned reference closely resembles the fixed-wing framework developed in *Small Unmanned Aircraft* by Beard and McLain. This framework is inherently modular and extensively documented so as to aid the user in understanding and extending for personal use.
